Through my upbringing and current life, love for environment has always been a main stay. My first field work was in Amboseli national park in 1994, where I was part of a delegation of students picked from across the country, to plant trees. In line with the late Prof. Wangari Mathai\'s word sof a humming bird, I first do the much I can. It may be a little, but my duty to the human race is to start by doing what I can.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>in 2006, together with my campus room mate, we started a waste management company, \"BINS ON WHEELS\" in an effort to contribute to proper waste management and disposal. The model we envisioned was to empower Nairobians to be able to \"treat their waste with taste\" because this would make recycling or re-using easier and cheaper. However, we ran into a few challenges and the company did not take flight as we both sought employment and the issue of cartels was too much do deal with.</p>\r\n<p>In a world of choices, I chose to study environmental management (First choice) at Makerere University. Environmental management has many areas and I will not take this time to expound on it, but it is the reason why I am still advocating for action for climate change, proper waste management and disposal, reduction, re-use, recyling, gender and environment, philosophy, biodiversity and ecosystems (Just to mention but a tip of the iceberg) .</p>\r\n<p>Mainstreaming of environmental issues or education and empowerment in everyday agenda is a life time\'s work. We must change how we do things so that the very environment we depend on does not suffer harm. Some damages are irreversible, for example, when global warming contributes to the extinction of species and loss of biodiversity. We must actively participate in efforts at all levels to inform developments, ideas, projects and any endeavour.</p>\r\n<p>I am an environmentalist through and through and I ca make a contribution as part of teams that are working to best management of the environment.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'),

Every living being has a right to live in an enabling environment, free from polution and degradation. My goal is to be the voice and hand of those living beings that cannot speak and a hand to those that have the will to better our sorrounding but cannot. To be the ear that listerns to the whispers of the trees, waves and the wind. To be the eye that sees and sends out a warning especially on possible consequences of not taking care of nature. Future global peace will be guaranteed only if those in position to act and take care of the environment today, do it.&nbsp;</p>'),

My current focus as a consultant is on health, safety, and environmental auditing and assessment. Companies who are required to comply with environmental standards need an evaluation of their facilities completed by a certified auditor to ensure they are complying with regulations. My experience is both diverse and comprehensive. To do this job well a person needs to continually adapt and transform to keep up with the issue of the day by applying transparency, good public relation traits, and demonstration of high level of integrity and professionalism. The work is never static and the ability to apply my skills and knowledge to a variety of subjects has enabled me to gain extensive experience. Adopting the professional responsibility to become a self-managed learner is essential to staying informed. I continuously interact with my peers in this field, read journals and research the Internet to gather information. I&rsquo;m confident that this has added more knowledge and skills to perform exemplary well as a Registered NEMA Lead Expert.

Through interaction with different organization both public and private, ensuring compliance to organization&rsquo;s policies, guidelines, procedures and legislations, I am able to answer and resolve any questions related to the organizations operations.</p>\r\n<p>I have successfully completed three years of experience under Eco-ethics and development, which is a registered firm of experts and under the mentorship of Dr, Stephen Njoka Nyaga who is a core director of the company and a registered lead expert. As a master&rsquo;s student in Kenyatta University Perusing Masters of Environmental Planning and Management, I was able to take a course in Environmental Impact Assessment and Audit as part of my curriculum, successfully completed, attained, and mean grade of B. &nbsp;I am well versed with computer skills, statistical tools, mapping tools and software, which will help in coordination, and ensuring critical analysis in order to make informed decisions. Additionally, my skills in Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and Environmental Audit (EA) have enabled me to write reports related to the projects and improve on my skills.</p>\r\n<p>I am particularly interested in the being a member of Environmental Institute of Kenyaand I highly believe I will use my knowledge and skills to bring impact to the society and the country at large.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your consideration.
